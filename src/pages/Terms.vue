    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      Please ensure that you have the correct driving licence documentation with you on arrival and that you meet the
      required legal eyesight conditions that the driving standards agency have set with or without glasses or contact
      lenses. Failure to do so will result in that you may not get to sit the practical driving test. You will still have
      to pay for your course in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot guarantee that you will be at a high enough standard to take your practical test after your course. The
      Pupil must reach a standard considered safe by the instructor before being allowed to take the tuition vehicle on
      Driving Test. The instructor's decision must be accepted as final. This is in the interest of the pupil, examiner
      and other road users and is as a precautionary road safety measure. It is not our policy nor that of the Driving
      Standards Agency to allow a pupil to take the Driving Test for the experience. We do not refund any test fee
      whatsoever. The school cannot be held responsible for cancellation of test due to unforeseen circumstances beyond
      our control.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are signs of alcohol or substance abuse then tuition will be lost until the pupil is in a fit condition to
      legally drive. Any abusive, offensive or other such conduct will not be tolerated and the course may be terminated
      without notice. We cannot be held responsible for any losses incurred due to misconduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      A non-refundable deposit of Â£250.00 is required when making the booking. Full payment must be paid 28 days prior to
      the course start date. If after 28 days prior to your course start date you cancel your driving course a refund of
      50% of the final payment will be paid. No other refund of monies paid will be given if you cancel your driving
      course 14 days or less prior to the course start date. Should you wish to change the dates of your course this may
      incur a charge. Cancellations that have not paid the deposit amount will be liable to this amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we, Residential intensive driving courses, have to cancel your driving course at any time due to circumstances
      beyond our control you will be offered an alternative date at no extra cost to you, or a full refund of all monies
      paid to us. We cannot be held responsible for the Driving Standards Agency changing or cancelling your driving test
      appointment at any time and for whatever reasons. And as a result of this happening you may still be expected to
      attend the driving course on the date that was originally booked, but we will endeavour to help arrange your return
      to complete your driving test at the earlest convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your test will be booked at the Kings Lynn DSA test centre, although we may also use other test centres that are
      within reasonable reach of Kings Lynn. You must not change or cancel the test without notifying us first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to Data Protection we will not discuss any pupil's individual aspect of the course without their written consent
